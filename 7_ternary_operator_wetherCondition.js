// Q7. You are building a weather application.
//  Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature as input and 
//  uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition.
//  If the temperature is above 30Â°C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".
